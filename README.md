# MERN Dungeons and Dragons
This application is currently *under development*. It is indended to help users by managing their character sheets, inventories, and more.
## Framework
This application uses the MERN fullstack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node).
## Installation
* `mongodb` - You'll need to install mongodb and create a database
* `Node` - I recommend installing via [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). This will also install `npm`
* `Express` is installed via express-generator. After installing node run:

* Run `npm install`, to install the dependencies.

## Running
Utilizing npm, the project is set up to run in one of two ways:

* `npm start` starts the server for deployment purposes
* `npm run start-dev` starts the server in a reloadable state where the server is reloaded upon changes.
