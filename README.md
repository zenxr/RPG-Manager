# MERN Dungeons and Dragons
This application is currently *under development*. It is indended to help users by managing their character sheets, inventories, and more.
## Framework
This application uses the MERN fullstack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node).
## Installation
* `mongodb` - You'll need to install mongodb and create a database
* `Node` - I recommend installing via [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). This will also install `npm`
* `Express` is installed via express-generator. After installing node run:

   `npm install -g express-generator`
* `React` - Will we use the react-generator.

  `npm install -g create-react-app`
* Enter the directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Running
Ensure mongodb is running, then `npm start` in terminal
